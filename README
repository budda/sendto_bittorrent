Send To BitTorrent

Developed by Budda <http://buddasworld.co.uk>


This extension makes clicked .torrent files go straight to your a
device on your network which has the official embedded BitTorrent
web client.

Such devices included the Netgear ReadyNAS range of network storage
boxes.

I have tested this extension with the Netgear ReadyNAS NV+


Setup

You must set the extension options to point to your NAS box where
the BitTorrent web client is running. For the NetGear ReadyNAS
the client runs on the same IP address as your ReadyNAS but on
port 8080. So the location could be http://192.168.1.200:8080


Usage

All web pages you visit will now be scanned for links ending
in ".torrent". Clicking on the link will send the torrent file
to your nominated device and provide a Chrome browser prompt
to confirm what was sent.
